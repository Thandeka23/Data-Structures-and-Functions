Overview

This project explores fundamental Python concepts, focusing on data structures (lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries) and functions. It also covers string manipulation, error handling, and debugging techniques. The project includes hands-on coding exercises to strengthen these skills.

Topics Covered

1. Lists, Tuples, Sets, and Dictionaries

Creating and modifying data structures.

Performing operations such as sorting, filtering, and iterating.

2. Introduction to Functions

Defining and calling functions.

Passing arguments and using return values.

Understanding scope and function best practices.

3. String Manipulation

Slicing and indexing.

String formatting techniques (f-strings, .format(), % formatting).

Useful string methods (split(), join(), replace(), etc.).

4. Error Handling and Debugging

Using try-except blocks to handle errors.

Debugging techniques such as print statements and logging.

Understanding common Python errors and how to fix them.
